# CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1
The last decades have reinforced the idea that **information processing** can be done more efficiently centrally, on large **farms of computing and storage systems** **accessible via the Internet**.

When **computing resources** in distant **data centers** are used rather than **local computing systems**, we talk about **network-centric computing** and **network-centric content**. 

**Advancements in networking and other areas** are responsible for the acceptance of the **two new computing models** and led to the grid computing movement in the early 1990s and, since 2005, to **utility computing** and **cloud computing**.
=============================================================================================

In **utility computing** the hardware and software **resources** are concentrated in large **data centers** and **users can pay as they consume** computing, storage, and communication resources. 

**Utility computing** often requires a cloud-like infrastructure, but its focus is on the **business model** for **providing the computing services**. 

Cloud computing is a path to utility computing embraced by major IT companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.
=============================================================================================

Cloud computing delivery models, deployment models, defining attributes, resources, and organization of the infrastructure discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 1.1

There are three cloud delivery models: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), deployed as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds
=============================================================================================

The defining attributes of the new philosophy for delivering computing services are as follows:

* Cloud computing uses Internet technologies to offer elastic services. The term elastic computing refers to the ability to dynamically acquire computing resources and support a variable workload. A cloud service provider maintains a massive infrastructure to support elastic services.

* The resources used for these services can be *metered* and the users can be *charged* only for the resources they use.  
    => Metered - To meter something such as gas or electricity means to use a meter to measure how much of it people use, usually in order to calculate how much they have to pay
    => Chaged - A charge is amount of money that you have to pay for a service

* Maintenance and security are ensured by service providers
    => Maintenance - The process of continuing something or keeping it in existence

* Economy of scale allows services providers to operate more efficiently *due to* specialization and centralization
    => due to - Because of
    
* Cloud computing is cost-effective due to resource multiplexing; lower cost for the service provider are passed on to the cloud users
