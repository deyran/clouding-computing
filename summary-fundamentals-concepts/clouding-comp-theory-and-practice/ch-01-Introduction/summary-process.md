# CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1
The last decades have reinforced the idea that **information processing** can be done more efficiently centrally, on large **farms of computing and storage systems** **accessible via the Internet**.

When **computing resources** in distant **data centers** are used rather than **local computing systems**, we talk about **network-centric computing** and **network-centric content**. 

**Advancements in networking and other areas** are responsible for the acceptance of the **two new computing models** and led to the grid computing movement in the early 1990s and, since 2005, to **utility computing** and **cloud computing**.
=============================================================================================

In **utility computing** the hardware and software **resources** are concentrated in large **data centers** and **users can pay as they consume** computing, storage, and communication resources. 

**Utility computing** often requires a cloud-like infrastructure, but its focus is on the **business model** for **providing the computing services**. 

Cloud computing is a path to utility computing embraced by major IT companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.
=============================================================================================

Cloud computing delivery models, deployment models, defining attributes, resources, and organization of the infrastructure discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 1.1

There are three cloud delivery models: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), deployed as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds
=============================================================================================

The defining attributes of the new philosophy for delivering computing services are as follows:

* Cloud computing uses Internet technologies to offer elastic services. The term elastic computing refers to the ability to dynamically acquire computing resources and support a variable workload. A cloud service provider maintains a massive infrastructure to support elastic services.

* The resources used for these services can be *metered* and the users can be *charged* only for the resources they use.  
    => Metered - To meter something such as gas or electricity means to use a meter to measure how much of it people use, usually in order to calculate how much they have to pay
    => Chaged - A charge is amount of money that you have to pay for a service

* Maintenance and security are ensured by service providers
    => Maintenance - The process of continuing something or keeping it in existence

* Economy of scale allows services providers to operate more efficiently *due to* specialization and centralization
    => due to - Because of

* Cloud computing is cost-effective due to resource multiplexing; lower cost for the service provider are passed on to the cloud users
    => Cost-effective - Producing good results withou costing a lot of money
    => Multiplex - Consisting of many elements in complex relationship

* The application data is stored closer to the site where it is used in a device- and location-independent manner; potentially, this data storege strategy increases reliability and security and, at the same time, it lowers communication costs  
    => Reliability - The quality of being trustworthy or of performing consistently well
=============================================================================================

Cloud computing is a technical and social reality and an emerging technology. At this time, one can only speculate how the infrastructure for this new paradigm will evolve and what applications will migrate to it. The economical, social, ethical, and legal implications of this shift in technology, in which users rely on services provided by large data centers and store private data and software on systems they do not control, are likely to be significant
    => Social - Relating to society or its organization  
    => Emerging - becoming apparent or prominent
    => Shift - To change or cause to change gradually
    => Rely on - To need (someone or something) for support, help, etc; To depend on (someone or something)
    => Likely - If something is likely, it will probably happen or is expected
=============================================================================================

Scientific and engineering applications, data mining, computational financing, gaming, and social networking as well as other computational and data-intensive activities can benefit from cloud computing. 

A broad range of data, from the results of high-energy physics experiments to financial or enterprise management data to personal data such as photos, videos, and movies, can be stored on the cloud.
    => Broad range - a group that includes many different things or people
=============================================================================================

In early 2011 Apple announced the ICloud, a network-centric alternative for storing content such as music, videos, movies, and personal information; this content was previously confined to personal devices such as workstations, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.
    => In early - Means near the beginning of a day, week, year, or other period of time.
    => Workstation - An area with equipment for the performance of a specialized task usually by a single individual

The obvious advantage of network-centric is the accessibility of information from any site where users can connect to the Internet.

Clearly, information stored on a cloud can be shared easily, but this approach raises major concerns: Is the information safe and secure? Is it accessible when we need it? Do we still own it?
