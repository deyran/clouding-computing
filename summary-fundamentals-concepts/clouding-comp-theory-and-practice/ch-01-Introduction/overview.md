# CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1
The last decades have reinforced the idea that information processing can be done more efficiently
centrally, on large farms of computing and storage systems accessible via the Internet
    >> Information processing > effeciently
        > centrally on large farms of computing 
        > storage systems accessible via the Internet. 

When computing resources in distant data centers are used rather than local computing systems, we talk about network-centric computing and network-centric content. 
    >> Computing resources > data centers rather than local computing systems
        network-centric computing and network-centric content

Advancements in networking and other areas are responsible for the acceptance of the two new computing models and led to the grid computing movement in the early 1990s and, since 2005, to utility computing and cloud computing
    >> Advancements in networking > "Computing models" 
        > "utility computing" 
        > "cloud computing"

=============================================================================================
In utility computing the hardware and software resources are concentrated in large data centers and users can pay as they consume computing, storage, and communication resources. 
    >> Utility computing > resources > data centers > users can pay as they consume

Utility computing often requires a cloud-like infrastructure, but its focus is on the business model for providing the computing services. 
    >> Utility computing > business model > computing services

Cloud computing is a path to utility computing embraced by major IT companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.
