# CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1
The last decades have reinforced the idea that **information processing** can be done more efficiently centrally, on large **farms of computing and storage systems** **accessible via the Internet**.

When **computing resources** in distant **data centers** are used rather than **local computing systems**, we talk about **network-centric computing** and **network-centric content**. 

**Advancements in networking and other areas** are responsible for the acceptance of the **two new computing models** and led to the grid computing movement in the early 1990s and, since 2005, to **utility computing** and **cloud computing**.
=============================================================================================

In **utility computing** the hardware and software **resources** are concentrated in large **data centers** and **users can pay as they consume** computing, storage, and communication resources. 

**Utility computing** often requires a cloud-like infrastructure, but its focus is on the **business model** for **providing the computing services**. 

Cloud computing is a path to utility computing embraced by major IT companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.
=============================================================================================

Cloud computing delivery models, deployment models, defining attributes, resources, and organization of the infrastructure discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 1.1. 

There are three cloud delivery models: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-aService (IaaS), deployed as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds.

The Cloud computing is divided in 5 aspects:
1. Delivery models
    1. Saas - Software as a Service
    2. PaaS - Plataform as a Service
    3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service 

2. Deployment models
    1. Public cloud
    2. Private cloud
    3. Comunity cloud
    4. Hybrid cloud

3. Infrastrucuture
    1. Distributed Infrastructure
    2. Resource virtualization
    3. Autonomous systems

4. Resources
    1. Compute & storage servers
    2. Networks
    3. Services
    4. Applications

5. Defining atributes
    1. Massive infrastructure
    2. Utility computing - Pay-per-usage
    3. Accessible via the internet
    4. Elasticity
